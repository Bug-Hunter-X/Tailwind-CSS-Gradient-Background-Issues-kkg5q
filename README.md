# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients and provides a solution.

The problem:

In some cases, Tailwind CSS gradients may not render correctly, especially when combined with other styles like `shadow-md` or `rounded-lg`. The gradient may be clipped, display artifacts, or not show at all.  This issue often arises from unexpected CSS specificity conflicts or incorrect gradient application.

Solution:

The solution provided addresses specificity issues by ensuring the gradient rules are applied with higher specificity. It also verifies the gradient definition is correct. Please check the `bugSolution.js` file for a working example.
